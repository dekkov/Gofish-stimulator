# Gofish-simulator
Simulator of the classic card game GoFish using c++ with dynamic arrays.
This is one of my projects for CS 162 at Oregon State University that I found interesting. It is really fun although a little bit time-consuming. This program use only dynamic arrays (no vectors although it is way easier for this program).
The game has 3 options: 1)normal gameplay - 2)debug mode - 3)advance bot gameplay.
